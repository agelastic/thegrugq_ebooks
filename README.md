# thegrugq_ebooks (Historical Archive)

This repository contains data and scripts for the `twitter-ebooks` Ruby bot based on the @thegrugq Twitter account.

## Overview

- `corpus/`: Historical tweet archive for @thegrugq (`thegrugq.json`).
- `model/`: Machine-learning model generated by `twitter-ebooks`.
- `bots.rb`: Bot definition script using `twitter_ebooks` and Twitter API credentials.
- `update.sh`: Script to re-fetch the tweet corpus and rebuild the model.
- `stopwords.txt`: Custom stopwords list used in text generation.
- `Procfile`: Process definition for running the bot (e.g., on Heroku).
- `Gemfile` & `Gemfile.lock`: Ruby dependency definitions.

**Note:** This project is a historical archive and is no longer maintained. Due to Twitter API changes and updates to the `twitter-ebooks` gem, the scripts and credentials included here will not work as-is.
